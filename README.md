# Graduation-Project-Data-Anaysis
This file will be included about my 4th grade graduation project and what Ä± ' ve done so far .
DATA SET TARGETS AND INTERESTED QUERY
Creating and visualizing a radiobox showing the weekly number of cases by continents
Applying the data mining prediction algorithm to daily vaccinations rates with python 
Determining the ceiling points of the number of cases of a specific country and visualizing and presenting them to the data
comparison of vaccination rates and hitting the average to find the 5 countries with the fastest vaccination rates in the world
gdp comparison of the least vaccinated country with the most vaccinated country
Identification of countries with the highest vaccination rate by continent, for example: Germany in Europe Asia: China
the formula I will use to find the vaccination rate will be as follows: population of the country / (number of vaccinations per day / total days) = vaccination rate
the purpose of this, for example, is that the vaccination rates of high-population countries are proportional to the vaccination rates of low-population countries
